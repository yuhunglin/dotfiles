## TODOs

* ~~fill out README: bootstrap.sh should be the entry point.~~
* De-dup functions defined in brew.sh vs laptop
* Run this against a new/packer build to test
* How can we get the laptop script runner run in a loop until all the things get installed properly
* serverspec test coverage.
* Evernote automation - or maybe find a non-intrusive alternative
* Iterm2, see if there's a defaults to point the dotfiles subdirectory
* * what is this iterm2/*.plist file doing.
* Look for something to configure the dock?
* ~~tc-mount/dismount aliases~~
* ~~dropbox to startup~~
