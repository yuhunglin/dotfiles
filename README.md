# Dotfiles

Reworked off off a mathias base for high sierra 10.13.

## Installation (from a new machine)

The `bootstrap.sh` should be sufficient to get Command Line tools, git and homebrew installed on a vanilla machine.

1. `mkdir -p ~/workspace && cd ~/workspace && curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuhunglin/dotfiles/sierra/bootstrap.sh && chmod +x bootstrap.sh && ./bootstrap.sh`

While the top level script is running
```
sudo scutil --set HostName <new name>
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
# Copy to github for the new machine
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
mkdir ~/workspace/ && cd ~/workspace/
git clone git@github.com:yuhunglin/dotfiles.git
cd ~/workspace/dotfiles
#git submodule init
#git submodule update
```

1. To run the rest of the install: `cd ~/workspace/dotfiles && ./run.sh`


### Specify the `$PATH`

If `~/.path` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files, before any feature testing (such as [detecting which version of `ls` is being used](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/aff769fd75225d8f2e481185a71d5e05b76002dc/.aliases#L21-26)) takes place.

Here’s an example `~/.path` file that adds `/usr/local/bin` to the `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Add custom commands without creating a new fork

If `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add a few custom commands without the need to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you don’t want to commit to a public repository.

My `~/.extra` looks something like this:

```bash
# Git credentials
# Not in the repository, to prevent people from accidentally committing under my name
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Mathias Bynens"
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="mathias@mailinator.com"
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
git config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
```

You could also use `~/.extra` to override settings, functions and aliases from my dotfiles repository. It’s probably better to [fork this repository](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/fork) instead, though.

### Sensible macOS defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible macOS defaults:

```bash
./.macos
```

### Install Homebrew formulae

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course):

```bash
./brew.sh
```

Some of the functionality of these dotfiles depends on formulae installed by `brew.sh`. If you don’t plan to run `brew.sh`, you should look carefully through the script and manually install any particularly important ones. A good example is Bash/Git completion: the dotfiles use a special version from Homebrew.
